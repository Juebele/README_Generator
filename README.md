This application lets the user create a ReadMe file based on a series of prompts. This is pretty handy, since I find myself writing ReadMe files a lot. It's not too polished; I coudl definitely use some help with formatting the template literal better and adding more questions to the workflow.

Instructions
just type "node index.js" in the terminal to run the program and then follow the prompts. It's so easy, a business major could do it
